Replaces static 2D floor plans. Effort: High.","pitch":"Every operator you cold-email will compare your pitch to whatever their architect already uses — and right now you're bringing a PDF to a SketchUp fight. A self-service 3D layout tool on your landing page turns tire-kickers into qualified buyers who've already designed their expansion before they reply. This is high effort but it's the difference between selling containers and selling a platform.","nextAction":"Get one real operator's site plan, build a minimal Three.js scene with 3 draggable container blocks, and test if load time stays under 3 seconds on mobile."},{"project":"Container HQ","title":"Custom Interior Component Prototyping","rawBody":"Use procedural AI CAD to rapidly design and 3D print custom container fixtures (security brackets, shelving) for premium move-in-ready units. Effort: Medium.","pitch":"Bare containers are a commodity — move-in-ready units with shelving and security hardware are a margin story, and every operator is currently improvising fixtures from big-box stores. Own the accessories supply chain through AI CAD + 3D printing and you turn a one-time steel sale into recurring revenue per unit. The window closes when a national vendor standardizes this, and nobody has yet.","nextAction":"Email 20 operators from your scraped list asking what interior mods they install most — shelving, brackets, lighting — and how much they spend per unit."},{"project":"Meal Flow","title":"Kroger API Grocery Integration","rawBody":"Integrate the open Kroger API as a third ordering channel to capture the Midwest/Southeast markets, enabling one-click checkout. Effort: Medium.","pitch":"Your one-click ordering only covers Instacart and Walmart, which means you're invisible to the entire Midwest and Southeast where Kroger owns 30%+ of grocery share. The Kroger API is open, well-documented, and virtually no meal-planning app has integrated it — this is a land grab for an underserved user base.

Your leads are sitting in a queue while humans check their phones, and every minute of delay drops conversion probability by double digits. An automated first-touch that fires within 60 seconds, scores the response, and only routes hot leads to a human compresses speed-to-lead from hours to nothing — this is the single highest-ROI automation in Birddog's entire stack.","nextAction":"Measure your current average lead response time, then spec the OpenClaw skill's trigger conditions, 3 email/SMS templates, and a scoring rubric with clear hot/warm/cold thresholds."},{"project":"Polymarket / Trading","title":"Signal-to-Bet Arbitrage Monitor","rawBody":"Build a fast monitoring system tracking verified geopolitical Twitter accounts, extracting events that match open Polymarket markets, and sending instant Telegram alerts.
